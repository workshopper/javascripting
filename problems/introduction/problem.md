# INTRODUCTION

To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop. 

Run this command to make a directory called `javascripting` (or something else if you like):

`mkdir javascripting`

Change directory into the `javascripting` folder:

`cd javascripting`

<<<<<<< HEAD

### The challenge:

>>>>>>> Added challenge word to some problems to difference the practice to explaination
Create a file named `introduction.js`:

`touch introduction.js` or if you're on windows, `type NUL > introduction.js`

Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:

```js
console.log('hello');
```

Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`javascripting verify introduction.js`
