An array is a list of values. Here's an example:

```js
const pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'rat']
```

### The challenge:

Create a file named `arrays.js`.

In that file define a variable named `pizzaToppings` that references an array that contains three strings in this order: `tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni`.

Use `console.log()` to print the `pizzaToppings` array to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```bash
javascripting verify arrays.js
```
