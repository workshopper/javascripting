Sometimes you will need to turn a number into a string.

In those instances you will use the `.toString()` method. Here's an example:

```js
var n = 256;
n = n.toString();
```

Create a file named `number-to-string.js`.

In that file define a variable named `n` that references the number `128`;

Call the `.toString()` method on the `n` variable.

Use `console.log()` to print the results of the `.toString()` method to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`javascripting verify number-to-string.js`
