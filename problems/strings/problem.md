A **string** is a sequence of characters. A ***character*** is, roughly
speaking, a written symbol. Examples of characters are letters, numbers,
punctuation marks, and spaces.

String values are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.

```js
'this is a string'

"this is also a string"
```

## NOTE

Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotation marks.

## The challenge:

For this challenge, create a file named `strings.js`.

In that file create a variable named `someString` like this:

```js
const someString = 'this is a string'
```

Use `console.log` to print the variable **someString** to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`javascripting verify strings.js`
