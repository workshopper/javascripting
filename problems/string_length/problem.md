You will often need to know how many characters are in a string.

For this you will use the `.length` property. Here's an example:

```js
const example = 'example string'
example.length
```

## NOTE

Make sure there is a period between `example` and `length`.

The above code will return a **number** for the total number of characters in the string.


## The challenge:

Create a file named `string-length.js`.

In that file, create a variable named `example`.

**Assign the string `'example string'` to the variable `example`.**

Use `console.log` to print the **length** of the string to the terminal.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

`javascripting verify string-length.js`
