You can access and manipulate object properties –– the keys and values that an object contains –– using a method very similar to arrays.

Here's an example using **square brackets**:

```js
const example = {
  pizza: 'yummy'
};

console.log(example['pizza']);
```

The above code will print the string `'yummy'` to the terminal.

Alternately, you can use **dot notation** to get identical results:

```js
example.pizza;

example['pizza'];
```

The two lines of code above will both return `yummy`.

## The challenge:

Create a file named `object-properties.js`.

In that file, define a variable named `food` like this:

```js
const food = {
  types: 'only pizza'
};
```

Use `console.log()` to print the `types` property of the `food` object to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```bash
javascripting verify object-properties.js
```
