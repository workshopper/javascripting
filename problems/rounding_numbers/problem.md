We can do basic math using familiar operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

For more complex math, we can use the `Math` object.

In this challenge we'll use the `Math` object to round numbers.

## The challenge:

Create a file named `rounding-numbers.js`.

In that file define a variable named `roundUp` that references the float `1.5`.

We will use the `Math.round()` method to round the number up. This method rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.

An example of using `Math.round()`:

```js
Math.round(0.5)
```

Define a second variable named `rounded` that references the output of the `Math.round()` method, passing in the `roundUp` variable as the argument.

Use `console.log()` to print that number to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```bash
javascripting verify rounding-numbers.js
```
