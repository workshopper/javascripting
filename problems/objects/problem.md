Objects are lists of values similar to arrays, except values are identified by keys instead of integers.

Here is an example:

```js
const foodPreferences = {
  pizza: 'yum',
  salad: 'gross'
};
```

## The challenge:

Create a file named `objects.js`.

In that file, define a variable named `pizza` like this:

```js
const pizza = {
  toppings: ['cheese', 'sauce', 'pepperoni'],
  crust: 'deep dish',
  serves: 2
};
```

Use `console.log()` to print the `pizza` object to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```bash
javascripting verify objects.js
```
