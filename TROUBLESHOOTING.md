# Troubleshooting

### `EACCESS` error

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, in either of the following ways:

- On unix shells, prefix the command with sudo
> `sudo npm install --global javascripting`

- On Windows and if using either PowerShell or CMD, ensure you open the shell with administrator privilege.

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

### `EEXIST` error

Make sure you are using an active version of Node.js. Active versions can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
