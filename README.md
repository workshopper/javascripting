## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org/download](http://nodejs.org/download)

### Install `javascripting` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install --global javascripting
```

The `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```
sudo npm install --global javascripting
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
javascripting
```

You'll see the menu:

Navigate the menu with the up & down arrow keys. 

Choose a challenge by hitting enter.

### Take a look at this gif that shows the first challenge:

![first challenge](javascripting.gif)

In the gif I'm using the command line editor `nano` ([here are some basic usage tips for nano](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/chapters/05-editors.md#nano)).  

You can use any editor you like. 

[atom](http://atom.io) or [brackets](http://brackets.io/) are both good options.
